# Machine Learning Basics

This repository serves as a comprehensive refresher on fundamental machine learning concepts, providing a solid foundation for deeper exploration. It encompasses end-to-end examples, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, using real-world datasets.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

* **`Seoul_Bike.ipynb`**: A complete pipeline demonstrating data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation on the Seoul Bike dataset.
* **`unsupervised.ipynb`**: Exploration of unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering algorithms, on various datasets.
* **`Magic.ipynb`**: Implementation of classification models on the Magic Gamma Telescope dataset, emphasizing model comparison and performance metrics.
* **`readme/`**: Contains additional resources and documentation to support the notebooks.
* **`download.png`**: Visual representation used within the notebooks for illustrative purposes.

## üß† Key Practices and Highlights

### 1. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**

Each notebook begins with thorough data exploration and cleaning:

```python
# Handling missing values
df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)

# Encoding categorical variables
df['category_encoded'] = df['category'].astype('category').cat.codes
```



This ensures that the data is in optimal shape for model training.

### 2. **Model Training and Evaluation**

The notebooks implement various machine learning models, assessing their performance using appropriate metrics:

```python
# Training a Random Forest Classifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluating the model
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```



This approach facilitates a clear understanding of each model's strengths and weaknesses.

### 3. **Visualization of Results**

To interpret model predictions effectively, the notebooks include various plots:

```python
# Confusion Matrix
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions)
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('Actual')
plt.show()
```



These visualizations aid in comprehending the model's performance and areas for improvement.

## üìä Notable Results

* **Seoul\_Bike.ipynb**: Achieved a high R¬≤ score, indicating strong predictive performance on bike rental counts.
* **unsupervised.ipynb**: Successfully clustered data points, revealing underlying patterns without labeled data.
* **Magic.ipynb**: Demonstrated the efficacy of ensemble methods in classification tasks, outperforming baseline models.
